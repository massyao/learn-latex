% ----------------------------------------
% This is an extensible preset to create well-structured LaTeX documents which
% can be edited by multiple people at the same time (e.g. using SVN). I have
% optimized the structure of the document for maximum productivity and included
% the packages which I found most useful.
%
% The key feature of this layout is, that all parts go into seperate files and
% are then included using the \input{} command of latex.
%
% Initially, this preset has been designed to write lab reports for several
% subjects at the "Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology
% Otto-von-Guericke-University Magdeburg", so the default structure is not
% suited to write a scientific paper. I translated most parts of this document
% to english.
%
% I think that by carefully reading the instructions given in this file, the
% file structure makes sense and can easily be adapted to your specific needs.
%
% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
%
% Quick-Start
% -----------
% 1. To create the document, run e.g. "pdflatex main.tex", all other files will
%    be included automatically using the "\input" command.
%
% 2. You can also use the Makefile to generate the document. This requires
%    additional programs to be installed and most likely only works on Linux.
%    See README for further instructions.
%
% 3. The preamble, source files and resources should be in the according
%    folders (include,src,res) the subfolders are self-explanatory.
%
% 4. It is imperative that two people do not work on the same file at once when
%    using Dropbox, otherwise you _will_ experience data loss. 
%
% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
%
% Using the Makefile
% ------------------
% In order to use the Makefile, you must install ghostscript and pdfcrop. The
% makefiles uses several features to speed up document compilation such as a
% precompiled preamble.
%
% You can furthermore place tikz plots in the folder 'src/tikz'. Each plot must
% be in a different file such as (src/tikz/example.tex):
%
% --BEGIN CODE--
%
%   %&tikz
%
%   \begin{document}
%     % PLOT CODE GOES HERE
%   \end{document}
%
% --END CODE--
%
% It is imperative to have the statement '%&tikz' on the first line, this is
% required to include the precompiled preamble for tikz plots.
%
% If you have any questions regarding this feature, please write me an email 
% since I've taken down my blog, which featured an explanation and I didn't
% have time to put it back online.
